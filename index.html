  <h1>Phishing</h1>
  <p>
    Phishing is a cyber attack that uses disguised email as a weapon. The goal is to trick the email recipient into believing that the message is something they want or need — a request from their bank, for instance, or a note from someone in their company — and to click a link or download an attachment.

  <h2>How Phishing Works</h2>
  <p>
    Attackers often send emails that appear to come from trusted sources. These emails may contain links to fake websites or attachments that install malware.
